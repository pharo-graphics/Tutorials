I am a visual card modelled by ==MgCardModel==

A model should be attached by sending #card: to the card element.
Card element reacts on model events such as MgCardFlippedAnnouncement and MgCardDisappearAnnouncement after card is flipped or disappeared.

By default I do not have a visual representations of the face and back
